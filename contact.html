                    <p>
                    Ever since i was a kid i was always interested in computer and how it works but never really had a chance to play with it properly. Once i came to United States,
                     I officially got my own computer and started learning about software and hardware of computer. Soon after, the interest converted into passion. I still remember 
                     typing "Hello world" for the first time in java and telling myself i want to do this but not just this. Few days later, i was introduced to youtubers who talked 
                     about how computer hardware works and how closely they work with computer software. At that exact moment, i said ,if i will want to continue my passion into a carrier 
                     then i am for sure working with computer hardware and connecting it to computer software. To put cherry on top ,i am really intrested into math in general(i know i am THAT girl who enjoys math),
                        and with some research i learned it won't take much to actually be part of cyber security team With my passion, i am currently pursuing a undergraduate degree 
                      in computer engineering with a minor in math at Texas A&M. Here, i am grabing more resources then i have had before. I am studying more algorithms, languages and higher 
                      mathematics. Here i am learning the system of machine (computer) is more complex then I thought. But yet my interest and passion on computer is growing more as i learn more. And 
                      i know the process of learning will never stop.Apart from my passion, i am a bilingual(3 human languages) and have been repeatedly exposed to new culture and diversity group of people.
                       This has made me able to adopt to changes and see different prospective . I am always curious about learning new things . I like problem solving and is very dedicate when it comes to finishing task .
                        I keep my goals and task organized to maintain productivity. In future i would wanna do what i do the best and continue learning more.
